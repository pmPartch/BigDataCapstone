# Big Data Capstone

Some R scripts for the UCSD Big Data (2015) Capstone project

* week1.R - is the week 1 data exploration done using the R language. Note that the csv files are expected to reside within the working directory of the R script

* Week3 BigData Capstone.Rmd - is the source R script used to generate, via Knitr, the HTML and PDF files. A replacement to the provided file _ReadingPySparkMLlib.pdf_ to show expected output. Note that I've added a couple of additional graphics to the original document:
    * a graph of the elbow function (refer to [Determining the number of clusters in a data set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determining_the_number_of_clusters_in_a_data_set))
    * a 2D graph showing the data points along with the cluster selection and cluster centers

* Week3_BigData_Capstone.html - HTML output from Knitr of .Rmd file above.

* Week3_BigData_Capstone.pdf - PDF output from Knitr of .Rmd file above.
